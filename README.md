# 🌐 HTML Elements Showcase

This project demonstrates a wide variety of basic HTML elements through individual example pages, including:

- Tables (with and without cell span)
- Lists (ordered, unordered, definition, and nested)
- Form controls (checkboxes, radio buttons, textarea, menu, etc.)
- Multimedia elements (audio and video)
- Organized HTML structure using semantic tags

Each page is linked from a central `index.html` page for easy navigation.
